# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

**Note to self:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append

`element.append()` gives us the ability to append string objects into the element. This would be used over `element.appendChild()` if we are appending multiple strings and nodes.
