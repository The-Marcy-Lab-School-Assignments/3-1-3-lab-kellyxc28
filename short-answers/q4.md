# Answer

**Note to self:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

1. 200 - This means the request has executed the option (GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE) successfully. It can tell us if the response is "ok" before continuing the rest of the fetch function.

2. 404 - This occurs when the server could not find the data that was requested because of the unknown URL. Another reason could be that while the URL was valid, the data is still hidden incase it was being accessed by an unauthorized user.

3. 500 - When there is a scenario the server does not know what to do with it, this status code is used. Supposedly, this can be used when the server is "down".
