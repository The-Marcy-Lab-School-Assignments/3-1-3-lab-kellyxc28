# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

Difference is `type="module"`

1. By using modules, we can reuse our code from different files.

2. By using modules, we can maintain the readability of our code by keeping it simple (each function does one thing).

Pretty solid answer, however I feel like both go hand in hand. For the second one, think of when the script tag will run when module is included.
