# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

Semantic elements are HTML tags that describe the element. This can be helpful when specifying the elements to the browser and users. Some examples of them are: `<form>`, `<header>`, `<video>`, and more.
