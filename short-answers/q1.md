# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer

HTTP GET request retrieves data while the POST request displays the data. In CRUD, GET request would be the R because it allows us to read data. POST request would be the C because it displays the data by creating an element with the data as its text context and "posting" that element onto the screen once appended. Another way to see data posted is through the console, in the body of a response.

Awesome Job! Keep in mind that post request sends this data to the server.
