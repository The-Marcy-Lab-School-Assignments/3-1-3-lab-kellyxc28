# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

The Request/Response Cycle is a process in which two computers are communicating through HTTP protocols.

A computer would be considered a client if it is the one sending requests. On the other hand, the computer that responds to these requests is a server.

The process always begins with the client sending a request to the server. The server should be waiting for requests and then accepting the requests once they are sent from the client.
